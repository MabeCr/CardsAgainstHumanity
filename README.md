#Not Cards Against Humanity
This is our little winter project where we try to recreate the game "Cards Against Humanity" in java (or whatever else is needed on the web development end). This was inspired by our long nights studying for finals, and taking a break to play an online version of the game that we found. Most of this (if not all, so far) has been written by scratch, and a lot still needs to be learned in order for this to become operational. However, we're up for the challenge.

#Current Status
A semi-working game is mostly finished. Users can load a custom card pack (will be able to load more than one in the future), pick a winner from a different client program, and most of the game logic is there. Cards images are created, and a mockup of the online view of the game is also mostly done. Coming together nicely.

We've decided to scrap the use of sockets and control the game using text files and php. Most of the php is finished, because Jackson is pretty much a baller. The new server shouldn't be all that hard to write, but it's just a little annoying to have to redo it. Nonetheless, progress progress progress.
